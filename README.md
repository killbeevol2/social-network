ACCEPTANCE CRITIERA

GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list

Getting Started
Use the following guidelines to set up your models and API routes:

Models
User

username

String
Unique
Required
Trimmed
email

String
Required
Unique
Must match a valid email address (look into Mongoose's matching validation)
thoughts

Array of \_id values referencing the Thought model
friends

Array of \_id values referencing the User model (self-reference)
Schema Settings

Create a virtual called friendCount that retrieves the length of the user's friends array field on query.

Thought

thoughtText

String
Required
Must be between 1 and 280 characters
createdAt

Date
Set default value to the current timestamp
Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query
username (The user that created this thought)

String
Required
reactions (These are like replies)

Array of nested documents created with the reactionSchema
Schema Settings

Create a virtual called reactionCount that retrieves the length of the thought's reactions array field on query.

Reaction (SCHEMA ONLY)

reactionId

Use Mongoose's ObjectId data type
Default value is set to a new ObjectId
reactionBody

String
Required
280 character maximum
username

String
Required
createdAt

Date
Set default value to the current timestamp
Use a getter method to format the timestamp on query
Schema Settings

This will not be a model, but rather will be used as the reaction field's subdocument schema in the Thought model.
